# Hierarchy_Ferrets

Calculate Functional dynamic analysis properties in a ferret dataset as in Idesis et al (2023).

These scripts use MATLAB (Except for Figure 3GHI which use python). They were tested using MATLAB 2020a. 

Installation and usage: Download and unzip the directory, open MATLAB, and then navigate to wherever you downloaded the files. You can run the script from within that directory.

They require no additional software packages with the exception of the HMM-MAR (Go to https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/HMM-MAR to download the latest version)
